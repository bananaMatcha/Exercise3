        <h2> Appliances and Technology</h2>
        
        <p>
            Appliances and equipment – including your kitchen and laundry appliances, TV, home entertainment, and office equipment – are a key factor in the energy use of your home. Home appliances and equipment use an average of 25% of household energy.
        </p>
        <p>
            New appliances are far more efficient than older designs, and upgrading your appliances and technology will reduce your energy consumption. When buying appliances or equipment, look for the right size to suit your household and lifestyle. If you simply buy the largest you can afford, you may waste money in running costs.
        </p>
        <p>
            Once you know the size you need, consider buying the most energy-efficient model that suits your needs. Most appliances must carry an energy rating label which tells you how efficient the model is compared with others of the same type and size. The more stars an appliance has, the more efficient it is.</p>
        <p>
            Look at the lifetime costs as well as the purchase price: a cheaper, less-efficient model will cost more in energy use in the long run. Use the Energy Rating Calculator to find out how much an appliance will cost you over its lifetime.
        </p>
        <p>
            Operate appliances efficiently by following the instructions, and keep appliances well maintained. Switch appliances off at the power point when you are not using them and when you go on holiday, unless it is necessary to have them switched on all the time.
        </p>

        <h2> Understanding appliances and technology</h2> 
        <p>
        Household appliances and equipment account for an average of 25% of total residential energy consumption across Australia. However, this proportion will vary by household depending on the climate, the types of appliances in your home, and the way they are used. Heating and cooling uses around 40% of household energy use.
        </p>
        <p>
        Appliances that use the largest amounts of energy include fridges and freezers (responsible for an average 7% of household energy use), clothes dryers (up to 10% of household energy use for heavy users), and TVs and home entertainment equipment (an average of around 5% of household energy use). In homes with a pool, the pool pump is a high user of energy (up to 18%). 
        </p>
        <P>
        Household appliances contribute to peak electricity demand, which refers to major spikes in electricity use that occurs at certain times (for example, between 5pm and 8pm when people arrive home from work and turn on their air-conditioners, TVs, lights, and other appliances). If peak demand exceeds the maximum supply levels, some regions can experience electricity outages. Supplying electricity for an ever-increasing peak demand requires building more electricity infrastructure, which is paid for by increases in energy prices.
        </P>
        <p>
        The National Construction Code sets minimum requirements for new homes in Australia, including a minimum star rating for thermal performance and a minimum Whole of Home energy use rating. The Whole of Home rating allows households to better understand the energy use profile of their home based on its design and major appliances and how these can work with renewable energy such as solar panels to see their overall usage. The Whole of Home rating includes the predicted energy use of air-conditioning, heated water system, lighting, and swimming pool and spa pumps.
