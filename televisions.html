        <p>
            On average, a new television uses more energy than a fridge. Many homes also have more than one television, increasing the load on the electricity bill. Taking time to choose your next television wisely and using it efficiently can decrease your energy use and save you money.

                 The price of electricity is going up. The average price of electricity in Australia has increased by 56% over the past decade. The price of electricity is expected to continue to rise. This is due to the increasing cost of generating electricity, the cost of maintaining the electricity network, and the cost of government environmental schemes.

                In summary, when choosing a television, consider the screen technology, size, and energy efficiency ratings. Opt for LCD screens, which consume less power, and select a size that fits your needs without being excessively large. Higher star ratings indicate better energy efficiency, so prioritize models with higher ratings to save on electricity costs.

                By making informed choices, you can enjoy your television while minimizing its impact on your energy bills and the environment.
