        <p>
            On average, a new television uses more energy than a fridge. Many homes also have more than one television, increasing the load on the electricity bill. Taking time to choose your next television wisely and using it efficiently can decrease your energy use and save you money.

                 The price of electricity is going up. The average price of electricity in Australia has increased by 56% over the past decade. The price of electricity is expected to continue to rise. This is due to the increasing cost of generating electricity, the cost of maintaining the electricity network, and the cost of government environmental schemes.
